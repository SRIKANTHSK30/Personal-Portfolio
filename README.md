## ✨ Overview

Welcome to my **personal developer portfolio**, a modern and interactive space where design meets functionality.  
This website reflects my **growth, creativity, and continuous learning** as a front-end developer passionate about crafting beautiful, intuitive, and performant web experiences.  

Built with **React**, styled using **Tailwind CSS**, and animated with **Framer Motion**, it combines clean design with smooth transitions and subtle motion effects — giving users an engaging and immersive experience.  

Every section of this portfolio represents a piece of my professional and creative journey:  
- from understanding **who I am**,  
- to showcasing **what I’ve learned**,  
- and demonstrating **how I build and innovate** through my projects.  

My goal was to build something that isn’t just a showcase — but an experience. 🌌  

> 💡 *This project is not only a reflection of my technical skills, but also my passion for turning imagination into functional design.*
